- Here, we are creating factory of factories.
- as we are increasing the layers of products, we have to create sub factories
- A factory is a class that returns products of a particular kind. For example, the ModernFurnitureFactory can only create ModernChair, ModernSofa and ModernCoffeeTable objects.

### Problem
Imagine that youâ€™re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:

1. A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.

2. Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco.

- You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture.
