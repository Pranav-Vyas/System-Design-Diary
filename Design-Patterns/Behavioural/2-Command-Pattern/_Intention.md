### Text editor
- commands ====> save, copy, click, hover, undo, redo
- for every command, some action needs to be performed
- we will treat commands like objects
- suppose for save button, we have ctrl+s
- by pressing this button, we need to perform same operation
- whatever request we give, we store it as an object
- in all of them we will have execute() function
- receiver execute something --> it takes action
- when we undo, we go one command back
- when we redo, we execute same command again
- we should able to send command/request as a parameter
- we try to decouple sender of request and receiver of request
- Interface ----> Command
- Concreate commands ----> Action save command, Action open command
- treat command as object
- point is whatever commands that are comming, you have to store it somehow
- so, store it as objects
